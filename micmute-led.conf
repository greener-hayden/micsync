# micmute-led-sync configuration
# 
# LED_MODE determines how the microphone mute LED behaves:
#
# "ucm"          - (Default, Recommended) Follow ALSA UCM best practices.
#                  LED only responds to internal (built-in) microphone.
#                  USB/Bluetooth microphones do NOT affect the LED.
#                  This is the most secure option following Case 1.
#
# "hybrid"       - UCM handles internal mic, userspace script handles USB mics.
#                  If the default source is the internal sound card,
#                  UCM controls the LED. Otherwise, this script controls it.
#
# "userspace"    - Legacy behavior. LED follows PipeWire/PulseAudio default
#                  source, regardless of whether it's internal or external.
#                  This provides the most consistent user experience but
#                  violates ALSA UCM security best practices.
#
# Note on Best Practices:
# The ALSA UCM documentation recommends Case 1 (LEDs respond only to internal
# resources) for security and predictable behavior. USB/Bluetooth microphones
# are considered external devices and should not control system LEDs.
# See: https://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/group__ucm__macro.html
